section "Versioning", for what MAJOR / MINOR / PATCH mean here.

## [0.0.2]

### Added

- `dart-conventions`: a distinct `// Future(<github-username>):` marker for
  deferred or temporarily hidden functionality (a parked feature, a
  commented-out screen/route, a control hidden until the backend is ready),
  kept separate from `// TODO` so deferred work is greppable on its own.

## [0.0.1]

Initial extraction of the shared Claude Code configuration into a standalone
repository, so it can be maintained in one place and reused across projects.

### Added

- `flutter-base` plugin distributed through the `claude-base` marketplace:
  - Test skills: `dart-add-unit-test`, `dart-checks-assertions`,
    `dart-collect-coverage`, `flutter-add-widget-test`,
    `flutter-add-integration-test`, `flutter-test-doubles`.
  - Cross-platform Telegram notification hooks (`Stop`, `PreToolUse`) with a
    Node dispatcher that runs the bash or PowerShell implementation per OS.
- Always-on instruction files under `instructions/` (`global`, `architecture`,
  `dart-conventions`, `packages`, `layers`), consumed by a project's `CLAUDE.md`
  through `@import`.
